        <p align="justify"> Beccas Cake was founded by Rebecca Aremu (formerly Olaojo), a passionate baker who turned her love for baking into a thriving business. What started in our home kitchen has grown into a bakery loved by families and businesses across the community.

            We believe baking is more than just mixing ingredients — it’s about creating memories. Every cake tells a story, every loaf spreads warmth, and every pastry carries joy.
